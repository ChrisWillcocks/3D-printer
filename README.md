# 3D-printer
Owning a 3D printer is fun, building one even more so.

Purpose of project is to have a fully functional 3D printer with options to upgrade.
Construction is intended to be easy and low-cost, so attempts are made to source from readily available materials. Project will not require access to an existing 3D printer.
More complete construction specs will emerge as project progresses.
